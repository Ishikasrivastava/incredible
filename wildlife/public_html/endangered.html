                <h2>Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros</h2>
            <img src="https://en-media.thebetterindia.com/uploads/2015/06/1.png" height="200" width="400">
           
            <p>The Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros, alias Indian Rhinoceros, are listed as one of the vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The animal can be found in India and Nepal, particularly in the foothills of the Himalayas. Poaching of horns is an important reason for the decline in the number of the Indian Rhinoceros. There has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros since 1975, but there is a consistent threat due to an increase in hunting cases. With at least half of the total population, India’s Kaziranga National Park remains the key reserve for this species. More efforts should be undertaken for the conservation of the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros.</p>

            <p>The Nilgiri tahr is a threatened mountain ungulate clinging on to the tropical rainforest of the Western Ghats. The endangered species have a stocky coat with a bristly mane, curved horns, and coarse and short fur. Considered as the state animal of Tamil Nadu, the Nilgiri Tahr is facing a major threat in the Western Ghats. Thanks to continuous poaching activities and Eucalyptus cultivation hampering its habitat, the Nilgiri Tahr population is continuously decreasing.</p>

            <p>Considered as the national animal of two major countries – India and Bangladesh, the Bengal tiger is justifiably referred to as the ‘Big Cat.’ Around 70% of the world’s wild tigers live in India. Tigers are fast vanishing due to human interference and poaching cases. The natural habitat of tigers in India – tropical evergreen forests, deciduous forests, mangrove swamps, thorn forests and grass jungles – has almost disappeared outside the reserves. Altogether, there are 48 tiger reserves in India. But one place that has captured the fancy of major wildlife aficionados is the Jim Corbett National Park. There are currently 2,226 tigers left in India.</p>

            <p>Gujarat in India is home to a large population of Asiatic lion aka the Indian lion or Persian lion. The King of the Jungle reigns supreme in India. As per the facts presented by WWF, the Asiatic lion can be only found in India. The 1,400 sq km Sasan Gir Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat is the last royal refuge of the Asiatic lion. Only 200 or so Asiatic lions exist in the wild.</p>
